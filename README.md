# Music App Churn Prediction

Project to predict user churn (account cancellation) for a fictional music app (Sparkify).  This project takes user action records (user info, page visited, timestamp, etc) as inputs.  These records will then be engineered to build features.  The resulting feature will used to generate a ML model for prediction.  Spark will be utilized to facilitate the analysis.
